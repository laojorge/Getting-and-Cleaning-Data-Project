# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project

This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. 
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 

The R script (run_analysis.R) does the following:

* Loads both the training and test datasets, keeping only those columns which reflect a mean or standard deviation
* Load the feature info
* Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges those columns with the dataset
* Merges the tree datasets
* Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.
* The end result is shown in the file tidy.txt.
